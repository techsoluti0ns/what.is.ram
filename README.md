*RAM*, also known as *Random Access Memory*, is one of the most important components in determining your computer’s speed and overall performance. So, whether you’re looking to buy a new computer, or you want to speed up your current PC, it’s crucial to understand what RAM is, and how much memory you actually need. Here’s everything you need to know about what *RAM* does, and how to find out if you have enough memory you have on your Mac or Windows computer.

## What Is RAM?

*Random access memory (RAM)* is a hardware component that is used to store temporary data for the programs running on computers, smartphones, gaming consoles, and other devices. Operating systems (like Windows and macOS) need to have a certain amount of memory installed just to boot up.

## What Does RAM Do?

You can think of RAM as your computer’s short-term memory. It provides temporary storage space for data and program codes that your computer is currently using. Your computer uses memory to launch programs, process actions, load features, and more.

While your hard drive and RAM are both measured in gigabytes (GB), they do very different things. You can think of your hard drive like your computer’s long-term memory, where all your files and programs are stored when they are not in use. However, the data stored in your RAM will be erased whenever you turn off your computer.

Your computer’s RAM is faster than the best long-term storage drives today. RAM stores commonly-used data that your programs, apps, or processes need on stand-by. This way, your computer’s memory can quickly pull up information and hand it over to your central processing until (CPU).

## How Much RAM Do You Need?

You will need at least 2 GB of RAM to use basic programs like Mícrosoft Word or surf the web. However, you should have at least 4 GB of RAM if you want to use newer apps. You might need 8-16 GB of RAM or more if you do lots of multitasking or use intensive programs.

As a general rule, the more RAM you have, the faster your programs will run, and the more programs you can run at the same time. However, your memory is only one part of the equation, and your computer’s overall performance will also depend on your other hardware and software.

To get the best performance out of your computer, it is recommended that you always purchase memory sticks in pairs with the exact same specs. This is because most computers these days come with dual- or quad-channel memory slots, which will provide your memory with more channels of communication and increase data transfer speeds.
